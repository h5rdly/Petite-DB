#                                  Petite
#                                  ------
#
#                      Compressed key-value storage
#
#  
#  Petite takes data made of key and value strings, and stores them in an archive
#  (currently a zip file). It can then look up and modify entries from that
#  archive.
#
#  New entries are committed to the archive on adding, no need for sync() or  
#  commit().
#
#  Deleted entries are added to a second file, and are periodically (or 
#  explicitly) purged from the main archive.
#    
#  Purging is done the purge() or compact() functions, which rebuild the archive 
#  with only the up-to-date entries.
#
#
#  Usecases: 
#   Petite may come handy for k-v stores where:
#
#     % much data is generated and stored initially, and relatively little is 
#       changed per usage.
#
#     % the value data is considerable (entries are not brief) - zip doesn't
#       use solid compression, will shine given per-file substance. 
#
#
#  - Python dbm compatible (dictionary-like access and behavior, with persistence)
#
#  - Portable - Single file, no external libraries needed
#
#  - Tested on Python 2.7/3.6 under Windows 10
